## 🌟 Introduction

Plant diseases are a major threat to food security, causing significant crop losses. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective management. This project aims to automate the process of identifying plant diseases by using computer vision and deep learning. By simply analyzing an image of a plant's leaf, the model can predict the presence and type of disease, enabling quicker and more informed responses.

This project was developed in a **Google Colab** environment using **Python** and popular **deep learning libraries**.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Class Classification**: Identifies multiple diseases across various plant species.
- **High Accuracy**: Built on a robust CNN architecture, achieving high precision in disease identification.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple to set up and run predictions on new images.
- **Scalable**: The architecture can be extended to include more plant species and diseases.
- **Jupyter/Colab Notebook**: Includes a detailed notebook (`.ipynb`) that covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
